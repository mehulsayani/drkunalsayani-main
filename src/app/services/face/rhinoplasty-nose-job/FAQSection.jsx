    question: "What is the primary purpose of rhinoplasty?",
    answer:
      "The primary purpose of rhinoplasty is to reshape the nose to improve facial harmony and proportion. It can also correct structural problems that cause breathing difficulties.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is a good candidate for rhinoplasty?",
    answer:
      "Good candidates are individuals who are physically healthy, have realistic expectations, are at least in their mid-to-late teens (when nasal growth is complete), and are bothered by the appearance or function of their nose.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do the results of rhinoplasty last?",
    answer:
      "The results of rhinoplasty are generally considered permanent. While the nose will continue to age along with the rest of your face, the structural changes made during surgery are lasting.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Will my nose look "fake" or "operated on"?',
    answer:
      'Myth: Modern rhinoplasty techniques, especially when performed by an experienced surgeon like Dr. Kunal Sayani, aim for natural-looking results that enhance facial harmony rather than creating an obviously "done" appearance. Fact: The goal is to create a nose that blends seamlessly with your other facial features, making it look as if it\'s the nose you were born with.',
  },
  {
    question: "Is rhinoplasty a painful procedure?",
    answer:
      "Myth: Many people believe rhinoplasty is extremely painful. Fact: While you will experience some discomfort, pressure, and dull aching after surgery, severe pain is uncommon and can be effectively managed with prescribed pain medication. The recovery is generally more uncomfortable than painful.",
