  "procedure": {
    "title": "The Thread Lift Procedure",

          "The threads, which have tiny cogs, barbs, or cones, are guided along the predetermined vectors. As the cannula/needle is withdrawn, the cogs/barbs grip the underlying tissue.",
          "Dr. Sayani then gently manipulates the threads to lift and reposition the sagging skin, creating an immediate tightening and lifting effect. The number and type of threads used will depend on the area and the desired degree of lift."
