You will receive detailed, personalized post-operative instructions, but here's a general overview of what to expect:",
    "phases": [
      {
        "phase": "Immediately After Procedure",
        "points": [
          "Dressing: A sterile dressing or bandage will be applied to the incision site. Keep this dressing clean and dry.",
          "Discomfort: You may experience mild pain, soreness, or tenderness at the surgical site. This is typically manageable with over-the-counter pain relievers or prescribed medication.",
          "Swelling & Bruising: Some localized swelling and bruising around the treated area are normal and expected. Applying a cold compress or ice pack gently (wrapped in a clean cloth, not directly on the skin) can help minimize these.",
          "Activity: Rest is recommended for the remainder of the day. Avoid strenuous activities."
        ]
      },
      {
        "phase": "First Few Days to 1 Week",
        "points": [
          "Dressing Changes: Follow Dr. Kunal Sayani's specific instructions for dressing changes. Keep the incision site clean and dry. Avoid submerging the wound in water (e.g., baths, swimming pools) until advised.",
          "Pain Management: Continue taking prescribed pain medication as directed.",
          "Activity Restrictions: Avoid vigorous exercise, heavy lifting, or any activities that put tension or stress on the incision line. Light walking is generally encouraged to promote circulation.",
          "Elevation: For procedures on the face or extremities, keeping the area elevated can help reduce swelling.",
          "Smoking/Alcohol: Avoid smoking and alcohol, as they can impair healing and increase complication risks.",
          "Monitor for Infection: Watch for signs of infection, such as increased redness, warmth, swelling, pus, or fever, and contact Dr. Kunal Sayani's clinic immediately if these occur."
        ]
      },
      {
        "phase": "Weeks 1-3",
        "points": [
          "Suture Removal: If non-dissolvable sutures were used, Dr. Kunal Sayani will remove them at a follow-up appointment, typically within 7-14 days.",
          "Scar Care (Crucial for Scar Revision): Once sutures are removed and the incision is fully closed, Dr. Kunal Sayani will provide specific instructions for scar care. This may include:",
          "Silicone Sheeting/Gel: Applying silicone sheets or gel to the new scar to help flatten, soften, and fade it.",
          "Massage: Gentle massage of the scar as advised to break down scar tissue and improve flexibility.",
          "Sun Protection: Protecting the new scar from direct sun exposure with clothing or high-SPF sunscreen. UV exposure can cause the scar to become permanently discolored.",
          "Activity: Gradually increase your activity level as tolerated, but continue to avoid activities that place excessive strain on the healing area."

      {
        "phase": "Months 1-12 (and beyond)",
        "points": [
          "Scar Maturation: Scars undergo a maturation process that can take 6-18 months, or even longer. They typically appear red or raised initially, then gradually flatten and fade to a lighter, less noticeable color. Continue diligent scar care as advised by Dr. Kunal Sayani.",
          "Follow-up: Attend all scheduled follow-up appointments with Dr. Kunal Sayani so he can monitor your healing progress and address any concerns.",
          "Long-Term Scar Management: For certain types of scars (e.g., keloids), Dr. Kunal Sayani may recommend ongoing treatments such as corticosteroid injections or laser therapy to optimize the final appearance."

    "description": "At Dr. Kunal Sayani's clinic in Mumbai, patient safety is our paramount concern. While the removal of lipomas and cysts, and scar revision procedures, are generally considered safe when performed by a qualified and experienced aesthetic surgeon like Dr. Kunal Sayani, it is essential to be aware of the inherent risks associated with any surgical procedure. Dr. Kunal Sayani will meticulously discuss these potential risks during your comprehensive consultation, ensuring you are fully informed.",
    "generalSurgicalRisks": [
      "Bleeding: Minor bleeding is common. Excessive bleeding (hematoma formation) is rare but may require drainage.",
      "Infection: Risk of infection at the incision site, minimized by sterile techniques and proper wound care.",
      "Anesthesia Risks: Adverse reactions to local anesthesia (e.g., allergic reaction, lightheadedness), though rare.",
      "Pain/Discomfort: Post-operative pain, managed with medication.",
      "Swelling & Bruising: Temporary and usually resolves within days to weeks."

    "lipomaCystRisks": [
      "Scarring: While Dr. Kunal Sayani uses meticulous techniques to minimize scarring, any incision leaves a scar. The goal is to make it as inconspicuous as possible.",
      "Recurrence: For cysts, if any part of the cyst wall is left behind, there is a risk of recurrence. Dr. Sayani emphasizes complete excision to prevent this. Lipomas can recur, though less commonly, if not entirely removed.",
      "Seroma: Collection of clear fluid under the skin, which may require drainage.",
      "Nerve Damage: Rare, but can occur if the lipoma/cyst is close to a nerve, leading to temporary or permanent numbness or weakness in the affected area.",
      "Damage to Surrounding Structures: Extremely rare, depending on the location of the lesion (e.g., blood vessels, muscles)."
    ],
    "scarRevisionRisks": [
      "Incomplete Improvement: Scar revision aims to improve the appearance of a scar, not completely remove it. Some residual scarring will always remain.",
      "Worsening of Scar: In rare cases, the revised scar might heal less favorably than the original, especially with keloid-prone individuals, or if post-operative instructions are not followed.",
      "Discoloration: The revised scar may be lighter or darker than the surrounding skin.",
      "Asymmetry: Slight differences in appearance between sides if treating paired scars.",
      "Recurrence of Keloids/Hypertrophic Scars: Individuals prone to keloids or hypertrophic scars have a higher risk of them recurring after revision, often requiring adjunctive treatments (e.g., steroid injections, radiation) to manage this.",
      "Numbness/Altered Sensation: Temporary or, rarely, permanent changes in skin sensation in the treated area."

    "minimizingRisks": [
      "Board-Certified Expertise: As a qualified aesthetic surgeon, Dr. Sayani possesses extensive training, profound anatomical knowledge, and vast experience in skin lesion excisions and scar revision techniques.",
      "Thorough Patient Assessment: A comprehensive medical history and physical examination are conducted to identify any contraindications or risk factors.",
      "Precise Surgical Planning: Meticulous planning of incision lines, considering skin tension lines and natural contours to minimize visible scarring.",
      "Sterile Environment & Techniques: All procedures are performed in a fully equipped, sterile clinic setting with strict adherence to aseptic protocols to prevent infection.",
      "Meticulous Surgical Technique: Dr. Sayani employs refined surgical techniques, including careful tissue handling, precise dissection, and multi-layered, tension-free wound closure, to promote optimal healing and minimize complications.",
      "Pathological Examination: Whenever necessary, removed lesions are sent for histopathological examination to confirm benignity and rule out any underlying concerns.",
      "Comprehensive Post-Operative Care: Providing clear, detailed instructions and close monitoring during the recovery period to ensure proper healing and early detection of any issues.",
      "Patient Education: Ensuring patients are fully informed about potential side effects, realistic expectations, and proper post-operative care."
