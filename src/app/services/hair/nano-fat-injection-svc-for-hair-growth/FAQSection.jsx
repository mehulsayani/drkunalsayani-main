    question: "What is a tummy tuck (abdominoplasty)?",
    answer:
      "A tummy tuck is a surgical procedure to remove excess skin and fat from the abdomen and tighten the abdominal muscles, resulting in a smoother, firmer contour",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is a good candidate for a tummy tuck?",
    answer:
      "Ideal candidates are generally healthy adults who have excess skin and fat in the abdomen that doesn't respond well to diet and exercise, have stable weight, and are non-smokers. Women who have had multiple pregnancies and have stretched abdominal skin and muscles are also common ",
  },
  {
    question: "Will a tummy tuck help me lose weight?",
    answer:
      "A tummy tuck is primarily a contouring procedure, not a weight-loss surgery. While some fat is removed, the main goal is to improve the shape and tone of the abdomen. It's best performed after you have achieved a stable and healthy weight.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do the results of a tummy tuck last?",
    answer:
      "The results of a tummy tuck can be long-lasting, especially if you maintain a stable weight and healthy lifestyle. However, significant weight fluctuations, pregnancy, and the natural aging process can affect your results over time.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of scars can I expect after a tummy tuck?",
    answer:
      "Scars are a permanent outcome of a tummy tuck. The length and location of the scars depend on the type of tummy tuck performed. Dr. Kunal Sayani will make every effort to place incisions discreetly, and scars typically fade over time, although they will remain visible.",
