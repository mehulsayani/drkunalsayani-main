      {
        "phase": "Immediately After Treatment (First 4-6 Hours)",
        "points": [
          "Avoid Touching/Rubbing: Do NOT rub, massage, or apply pressure to the treated areas for at least 4-6 hours. This is crucial to prevent the Botox from migrating to unintended muscles, which could lead to unwanted side effects like drooping.",
          "Stay Upright: Remain upright for at least 4 hours after your injections. Avoid lying down, bending over significantly, or engaging in activities that require you to lie flat (e.g., certain yoga poses, deep stretching).",
          "Avoid Strenuous Activity: Refrain from vigorous exercise, heavy lifting, or any activity that significantly increases your heart rate or blood flow to the face for at least 24 hours.",
          "Facial Expressions: You can gently make facial expressions (e.g., frown, smile, raise eyebrows) in the treated areas. This can help the Botox integrate into the muscle and potentially lead to faster onset of results, but avoid overdoing it.",
          "No Headwear/Facial Products: Avoid wearing tight hats, headbands, or applying any facial products or treatments that require rubbing or pressure on the treated areas for the first few hours."

These are temporary and typically subside within a few hours to a couple of days. You can apply a cold compress or ice pack gently (wrapped in a cloth, not directly on the skin) to minimize these effects.",
          "Avoid Alcohol: Refrain from alcohol consumption for at least 24 hours as it can increase the risk of bruising.",

          "Avoid Facial Massages/Treatments: Avoid vigorous facial massages, microdermabrasion, chemical peels, or other intense facial treatments for at least two weeks to allow the Botox to fully settle.",
          "Follow-up (Optional): Dr. Kunal Sayani may recommend a follow-up appointment in 2-3 weeks to assess your results and perform any minor touch-ups if needed.",

      "Redness, Swelling, Tenderness: At the injection sites. These are usually mild and short-lived.",

      "Drooping Eyelid (Ptosis) or Eyebrow: This is a rare side effect, usually temporary (lasting a few weeks to months), and typically occurs if the Botox migrates to an unintended muscle. It is minimized by Dr. Kunal Sayani's precise injection technique and by strictly following post-treatment instructions (e.g., avoiding rubbing, staying upright).",
      "Asymmetry: Slight unevenness in facial expressions or eyebrow position. This can often be corrected with a touch-up injection by Dr. Kunal Sayani.",

    "veryRareSideEffects": [
      "Spread of Toxin Effect: In exceedingly rare instances, the botulinum toxin could spread beyond the injection site, potentially causing serious symptoms hours to weeks after injection, such as generalized muscle weakness, double vision, blurred vision, difficulty swallowing or breathing, or loss of bladder control. This risk is primarily associated with very large doses used for certain medical conditions and is almost unheard of in cosmetic use when administered correctly."
