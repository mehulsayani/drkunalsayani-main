    "options": [
      "Silicone Implants: Provide a more natural feel, ideal for women with minimal natural breast tissue.",
      "Saline Implants: Filled with sterile saltwater; adjustable and inserted via a smaller incision.",
      "Gummy Bear Implants: Cohesive silicone gel implants that maintain their shape and resist leakage.",
      "Fat Transfer Augmentation: Uses liposuctioned fat from other areas of the body to subtly enhance breast volume without implants."

      {
        "step": "Anesthesia",
        "description": "The surgery is performed under anesthesia for patient comfort. Options include intravenous sedation or general anesthesia, tailored to the patient’s health and surgeon’s recommendation."

        "points": [
          "Along the edge of the areola (peri-areolar)",
          "In the fold beneath the breast (inframammary fold)",
          "In the armpit (axillary)"
        ],
        "note": "The incision choice depends on implant type, desired breast size, anatomy, and patient preference. A transumbilical (belly button) approach is less common and associated with higher complication rates."

        "step": "Implant Placement",
        "description": "After the incision, the implant is inserted into a pocket either:",

      {
        "step": "Implant Types",
        "description": "Implants are typically filled with either sterile saline or silicone gel. Both have distinct characteristics affecting feel, risk of rupture, and appearance. Fat transfer is an alternative technique using the patient’s own fat to augment breast volume."

Choosing a board-certified, experienced plastic surgeon like Dr. Kunal Sayani and following all pre- and post-operative instructions can significantly reduce risks but not eliminate them entirely.",

    "implantRelatedRisks": [
      "Capsular Contracture: Scar tissue hardens around the implant, causing pain, firmness, and breast distortion. Treatment may require surgery.",
      "Implant Rupture or Deflation: Saline implants deflate visibly; silicone ruptures may be silent or cause swelling and shape changes. Surgical replacement is necessary.",
      "Implant Displacement or Migration: Implants may shift position, causing asymmetry; may require corrective surgery.",
      "Changes in nipple and breast sensation, sometimes permanent.",
      "Additional surgeries may be needed for complications or implant replacement.",
      "Rare but serious risks include breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) and other cancers.",
