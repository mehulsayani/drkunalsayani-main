    question: "What is the main goal of Otoplasty?",
    answer:
      "The primary goal is to improve the shape, position, or proportion of the ear, most commonly to correct protruding ears, making them sit closer to the head and appear more natural and balanced with the face.",
  },
  {
    question: "At what age can Otoplasty be performed?",
    answer:
      "Otoplasty is commonly performed on children once their ears have reached near full development, typically around age 5-7. However, Dr. Kunal Sayani also performs Otoplasty on teenagers and adults of any age who are in good health and wish to correct their ear appearance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Otoplasty a painful procedure?",
    answer:
      "The procedure itself is not painful as it is performed under anesthesia (local with sedation or general). Post-operatively, some discomfort, aching, or throbbing is expected for a few days, but this is usually well-managed with prescribed or recommended pain medication by Dr. Kunal Sayani.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the Otoplasty procedure take?",
    answer:
      "Typically, Otoplasty takes between 1 to 3 hours, depending on the complexity of the correction needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will I have visible scars after Otoplasty?",
    answer:
      "Dr. Kunal Sayani strategically places incisions in inconspicuous locations, usually in the natural crease behind the ear. When incisions are needed on the front, they are hidden within natural folds. Over time, these scars typically fade and become barely noticeable.",
