  "introduction": "Proper recovery and diligent adherence to post-operative instructions are crucial for achieving optimal results after rhinoplasty with Dr. Kunal Sayani. While individual healing times vary, here's a detailed guide to what you can generally expect.",
  "recovery": {
    "title": "Recovery & Aftercare (Post-Op Instructions)",
    "phases": [
      {
        "phase": "Immediately After Surgery (First 24-72 Hours)",
        "points": [
          "Discomfort and Medication: Expect some pain, discomfort, and a dull ache in your nose, managed with prescription pain medication taken as directed.",
          "Swelling and Bruising: Significant swelling and bruising around the nose and eyes are normal, possibly extending to cheeks with dark purple or black discoloration. Apply cold compresses to eyes (not nose) to reduce this.",
          "Splint and Dressing: A splint (external, internal, or both) protects and maintains the nose's new shape. Soft packing inside nostrils supports and absorbs drainage.",
          "Drainage: Light bleeding or clear drainage from nostrils is common, with a drip pad under the nose to absorb it, changed as needed.",
          "Head Elevation: Keep head elevated at all times, even while sleeping, for at least the first week using two or three pillows or a recliner to minimize swelling.",
          "Rest: Get plenty of rest and avoid any strenuous activity."
        ]
      },
      {
        "phase": "The First Week",
        "points": [
          "Splint Removal: External splint and internal packing are typically removed by Dr. Kunal Sayani around 5-7 days post-surgery, though the nose remains swollen.",
          "Bruising and Swelling: Bruising fades from purple to yellowish-green, and swelling starts to subside, but the nose, especially the tip, remains noticeably swollen.",
          "Avoid Blowing Your Nose: Do not blow your nose for at least 2-3 weeks to prevent disrupting healing tissues. Sneeze with your mouth open.",
          "Gentle Cleaning: Follow instructions to gently clean incision sites (if applicable) and nostrils with saline spray or prescribed solution.",
          "Diet: Stick to soft, easily chewable foods initially to avoid excessive facial movement.",
          "Activity: Continue resting, avoiding strenuous activities. Light walking is encouraged to promote circulation.",
          "Glasses/Sunglasses: Avoid glasses or sunglasses resting on the nose bridge for 4-6 weeks to prevent indenting healing bones and cartilage. Use taped glasses or contact lenses."
        ]
      },
      {
        "phase": "Weeks 2-4",
        "points": [
          "Swelling Reduction: Significant swelling resolves, particularly in the upper nose, though the tip may remain swollen longer.",
          "Return to Activities: Return to light, non-strenuous work or school within 1-2 weeks. Avoid vigorous exercise, heavy lifting, or activities risking nasal trauma for 4-6 weeks.",
          "Sun Protection: Protect nose from direct sun exposure to prevent prolonged swelling and discoloration, using sunscreen (once cleared by Dr. Sayani) and a wide-brimmed hat.",
          "Oral Hygiene: Brush teeth gently, especially upper teeth, to avoid disturbing the nose."
        ]
      },
      {
        "phase": "Months 1-6",
        "points": [
          "Continued Swelling Resolution: Swelling diminishes, with the nose's final shape emerging. The tip may take up to a year or longer to fully resolve.",
          "Scar Maturation: External incisions fade and soften.",
          "Exercise: Gradually reintroduce strenuous exercise as cleared by Dr. Kunal Sayani, avoiding contact sports for at least 6 months."
        ]
      },
      {
        "phase": "Long-Term (6 Months to 1+ Year)",
        "points": [
          "Final Results: Final rhinoplasty results typically visible by one year, with subtle changes possible longer.",
          "Patience: Continuous subtle changes occur as swelling resolves and tissues settle, requiring patience.",
          "Follow-ups: Attend all scheduled follow-up appointments with Dr. Kunal Sayani to ensure optimal healing and address concerns."

    "title": "Risks & Safety",

    "specificRisks": [
      "Anesthesia Risks: Possible reactions include nausea, vomiting, or rare serious cardiac or respiratory complications, minimized by pre-operative evaluation and skilled anesthesiologist.",
      "Bleeding (Hematoma): Minor bleeding is normal; excessive bleeding or hematoma may require intervention.",
      "Infection: Rare, minimized by sterile techniques and possible antibiotics.",
      "Poor Wound Healing or Scarring: Issues with healing may occur despite meticulous incisions; external scars are subtle but permanent, and internal scarring may affect breathing.",
      "Numbness or Change in Skin Sensation: Temporary or rare permanent numbness in nose or surrounding areas due to nerve irritation or damage.",
      "Nasal Obstruction or Difficulty Breathing: Rare risk of developing or worsening breathing difficulties due to compromised nasal structures or excessive internal scarring.",
      "Nasal Septal Perforation: Very rare hole in the nasal septum, which may or may not require further surgery.",
      "Asymmetry: Minor asymmetries may persist despite precision, as perfect symmetry is rarely achievable.",
      "Dissatisfaction with Aesthetic Outcome: Possible dissatisfaction despite alignment with goals, requiring clear communication of expectations.",
      "Skin Discoloration or Swelling: Prolonged swelling, especially at the tip, or discoloration (e.g., redness, hyperpigmentation) in certain skin types or with sun exposure.",
      "Need for Revision Surgery: Secondary rhinoplasty may be needed after 12-18 months to correct imperfections, address complications, or refine results."
