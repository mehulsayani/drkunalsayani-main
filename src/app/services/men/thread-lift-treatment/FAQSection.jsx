    question: "What is a Thread Lift?",
    answer:
      "A Thread Lift is a minimally invasive cosmetic procedure that uses dissolvable sutures (threads) inserted under the skin to lift and tighten sagging facial and neck tissues, providing a more youthful and contoured appearance. The threads also stimulate collagen production.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does a Thread Lift work?",
    answer:
      "The threads have tiny barbs or cones that grip the skin and underlying tissues, allowing them to be gently pulled upwards to create an immediate lifting effect. Over time, the threads dissolve, but their presence stimulates your body's natural collagen production, providing long-term skin tightening and rejuvenation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is a good candidate for a Thread Lift?",
    answer:
      "Ideal candidates are typically individuals in their 30s to 50s who have mild to moderate facial sagging, good skin elasticity, and realistic expectations. They are often looking for a noticeable lift but are not ready for a surgical facelift. Dr. Kunal Sayani will assess your suitability during a detailed consultation.",
  },
  {
    question: "What areas can be treated with a Thread Lift?",
    answer:
      "Commonly treated areas include the mid-face (cheeks), jowls, jawline, eyebrows, and neck. It can effectively improve mild sagging, redefine contours, and soften lines.",
  },
  {
    question: "What types of threads does Dr. Kunal Sayani use?",
    answer:
      "Dr. Kunal Sayani uses various types of medical-grade, dissolvable threads, such as PDO (Polydioxanone), PLLA (Poly-L-Lactic Acid), and PCA (Polycaprolactone), chosen based on your specific needs for lift, collagen stimulation, and longevity.",
