    question: "What is a lipoma?",
    answer:
      "A lipoma is a common, benign (non-cancerous) fatty tumor that typically forms just under the skin. It feels soft, rubbery, and can be moved around with your fingers. Lipomas are usually harmless but can grow large or cause discomfort if they press on nerves or organs.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a skin cyst?",
    answer:
      "A skin cyst is a sac-like pocket of tissue under the skin that can be filled with fluid, air, pus, or other material. Common types include epidermal cysts (often called sebaceous cysts, though technically different) and pilar cysts. They usually appear as a smooth lump and can sometimes become inflamed or infected.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are lipomas or cysts dangerous?",
    answer:
      "Most lipomas and cysts are benign (non-cancerous) and not dangerous. However, it's always recommended to have any new or growing lump evaluated by a medical professional like Dr. Kunal Sayani to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any rare underlying conditions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why should I have a lipoma or cyst removed?",
    answer:
      "While often benign, people choose to have lipomas or cysts removed for various reasons:\n• Aesthetic concern: They may be unsightly, especially on visible areas.\n• Discomfort or pain: If they grow large, press on nerves, or become inflamed.\n• Infection: Cysts can sometimes rupture or become infected, requiring medical attention.\n• Uncertainty: To confirm the diagnosis and rule out malignancy.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the removal procedure painful?",
    answer:
      "The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, so you will not feel pain during the removal. You may feel some pressure or movement. Any post-operative discomfort is usually mild and easily managed with over-the-counter pain relievers.",
  },
