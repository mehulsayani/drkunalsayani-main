  "procedure": {
    "title": "The Liposuction Procedure",
    "description": "Liposuction is typically performed on an outpatient basis under local anesthesia with sedation, or general anesthesia, depending on the extent of the areas being treated and your comfort level. Dr. Kunal Sayani will discuss the best anesthesia option for you.",
    "steps": [
      {
        "step": "Anesthesia",
        "description": "The chosen anesthesia will be administered to ensure your comfort throughout the procedure."
      },
      {
        "step": "Incision Sites",
        "description": "Dr. Kunal Sayani makes small, discreet incisions (typically only a few millimeters in length) in the target areas. These incisions are strategically placed in natural skin folds or less visible areas to minimize scarring."
      },
      {
        "step": "Tumescent Solution Infiltration",
        "description": "A sterile solution, known as tumescent fluid (a mixture of saline, lidocaine for local anesthetic, and epinephrine to constrict blood vessels and minimize bleeding), is injected into the fatty tissue. This solution numbs the area, makes fat removal easier, and reduces bruising and blood loss."
      },
      {
        "step": "Fat Removal",
        "description": "A thin, hollow tube called a cannula is inserted through the small incisions. Dr. Kunal Sayani meticulously moves the cannula back and forth to gently break up and dislodge the fat cells. A vacuum pump or syringe is then attached to the cannula to suction out the loosened fat. Dr. Sayaniâ€™s artistic approach ensures smooth, even fat removal for a natural-looking contour."
      },
      {
        "step": "Closing Incisions",
        "description": "Once the desired amount of fat has been removed and the area is sculpted to your satisfaction, the small incisions are typically left open to drain excess fluid, or sometimes closed with dissolvable sutures."
      },
      {
        "step": "Compression Garment Application",
        "description": "A compression garment is applied immediately after the procedure. This garment is crucial for reducing swelling, promoting skin retraction, and helping the treated areas conform to their new contours."
