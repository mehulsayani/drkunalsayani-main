      "Difficulty Closing Eyes (Lagophthalmos): Rare inability to fully close eyelids due to excessive skin removal, usually temporary from swelling, but may require drops or revision surgery.",
      "Ectropion (Lower Eyelid Pulling Downward): Rare lower eyelid pull exposing white of eye, causing irritation and aesthetic concerns, possibly requiring corrective surgery.",
      "Asymmetry: Minor differences in eye appearance may occur despite efforts for symmetry, as perfect symmetry is not always achievable.",
      "Numbness or Altered Sensation: Temporary or rare permanent numbness in eyelids due to nerve irritation or damage.",
      "Blurred or Double Vision: Temporary due to swelling or ointment; permanent vision changes extremely rare.",
      "Milia: Small white cysts along incision lines, usually easily treated.",
