    question: "Who is an ideal candidate for jawline contouring with Dr. Kunal Sayani?",
    answer:
      "Ideal candidates are individuals who are generally healthy, have realistic expectations, and are bothered by a poorly defined jawline, jowls, a double chin, or a weak chin. Specific candidacy depends on your unique anatomy and aesthetic goals, which Dr. Kunal Sayani will assess during your consultation.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do the results of jawline contouring last?",
    answer:
      "The longevity varies greatly. Non-surgical options like fillers last 12–24 months, neuromodulators 4–6 months, and Kybella results are permanent as fat cells are destroyed. Surgical procedures like liposuction and chin implants offer permanent results, though the natural aging process will continue. Facelift/neck lift results are long-lasting, often for 10–15 years.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is jawline contouring painful?",
    answer:
      "Non-surgical treatments typically involve minimal discomfort, often managed with topical numbing cream. Surgical procedures are performed under local or general anesthesia, so you won't feel pain during the procedure. Post-operative discomfort is managed with prescribed pain medication.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long is the recovery time?",
    answer:
      "Recovery for non-surgical treatments is minimal (a few hours to a few days of mild swelling/bruising). Surgical procedures require more downtime, ranging from 1–2 weeks for initial recovery to several months for complete swelling resolution and final results.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can jawline contouring help with a double chin?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! Submental liposuction or Kybella injections are specifically designed to address and eliminate a double chin, revealing a more defined jawline.",
